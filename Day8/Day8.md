(Interfaces or Pure VirtualFunctions)
A pure virtual function in C++ is a special kind of virtual function 
that has no implementation in the base class and is meant to be overridden
by derived classes. It is declared in the base class using the virtual 
keyword and is assigned the = 0 syntax at the end of its declaration, 
indicating that it has no implementation in the base class.
