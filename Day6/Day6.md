(ConstructorDestructor)

Constructors:
Constructors are special member functions of a class.  
They have the same name as the class and are used to initialize objects when they are created.  
Constructors can accept arguments or be parameterless.  
They allocate memory for an object and set its initial state.  
Constructors can be overloaded (multiple constructors with different parameters) within a class.  
Destructors:  
Destructors are also special member functions of a class.  
They have the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (~) operator.  
Destructors are called automatically when an object is destroyed (e.g., when it goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted).  
Their primary purpose is to release resources (such as memory) held by an object.  
Unlike constructors, there is only one destructor per class, and it cannot be overloaded.  

(inheritance)  
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP).  
It allows one class (the base class or parent class) to pass on its properties and behaviors to another class (the derived class or child class).  
The derived class inherits features (such as member variables and member functions) from the base class, promoting code reuse and organization
